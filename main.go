             -> (handler not exist?) -> return 404
             -> (handler exist but method not allowed?) -> return 405
             -> (handler exist)
                                \
                                 -> query timeline, circuit breaker not open yet? -> proxy and return, then save the response status
                                 -> circuot breaker is open? return 429 too many requests
